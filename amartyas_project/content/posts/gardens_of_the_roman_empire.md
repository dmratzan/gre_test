#### Findings

The artificial terrace that now carries the Barberini family name is located on the northeastern corner of
the Palatine, beyond the visible remains of the Flavian Imperial palace (Fig. 1). Excavations carried out
during the 1930s by A. Bartoli, and in the 1950s by G. F. Carettoni concentrated primarily on the central
area of this site. These campaigns revealed the foundations of a large temple, which Bartoli identified,
consistent with the earlier ideas of P. Bigot, as the remains of the late second-century temple of
Elagabalus.
>Recent investigations by the Soprintendenza Archeologica in collaboration with École française
de Rome have revealed further episodes of the history of the area.
Approximately one third of the site has been explored, although the most ancient levels have been
reached only sporadically (Fig. 2).

#### Analysis

The information gathered during the campaigns carried out annually
between 1985 and 1999 are at present being analyzed, so that some of the information presented here
must be considered provisional.
The excavations that reached levels prior to the rise of the Empire revealed a peristyle of a large
domus once decorated with plants and basins.
>Probably destroyed during the 60s of the first century
A.D., this luxurious dwelling was then buried under thick layers of soil used to create an artificial terrace
that was a grand garden of the palace of Domitian. About a century later, during the last years of the second century, this section of the Imperial palace was demolished to
make room for a monumental complex
centered around a temple dedicated by
the emperor Heliogabalus to the
eastern god, Elagabalus, later
rededicated by Alexander Severus to
Jupiter Ultor.

### THE GARDEN OF THE PERISTYLE OF THE JULIO-CLAUDIA DOMUS

#### Findings

At the end of the republican era and the beginning of the Empire residential dwellings occupied, at least
in part, the northeastern corner of the Palatine. Two distinct excavation areas have revealed the partial
remains of one or more domus in the southern part of the terrace, some 6.5 meters below the present
ground level.
>The two excavated sections have not been joined because of a wide road of Severan date
that divides them. It is not possible, therefore, to ascertain whether the pre-Domitianic remains, on
either side of this road, belong to a single domus. It is clear, however, the remains all share several
features: obliqueness with respect to the later platform, building materials and techniques, and a
luxurious quality.

The most coherent remains belong to the northwest corner of a peristyle oriented WSW-ENE.
Enough is preserved to show that this was a rectangular peristyle with six columns along the west, and
more along the, not fully uncovered, north side.
>Remaining are the foundations of the colonnade, two
column bases and several important sections of
the peripheral walls (Fig. 3). In addition,
several marble paving slabs were found in
place. Impressions of others, the result of the
removal of slabs in antiquity in preparation for
a layer of simple pozzolana, reveal the original
pattern. The slabs were cut into squares and
rectangles, based on a Roman foot or half-foot,
from three different marbles: Chemtou (Giallo
Antico), “Africano” and “Palombino (coming,
respectively, from northwest Tunisia, the
surroundings of Smyrna, and an unknown
location). Set at a 45º angle with respect to the
peristyle galleries, this pavement was limited
on one side by the colonnade, and on the other
by the back gallery walls, built with large
blocks of tufa and limestone. Between the
columns were white marble paving slabs with grooves, perhaps indicating they supported light barriers.

domus.*

#### Further Findings

The garden area enclosed by the colonnade (Fig. 4) contained two basins, below the level of the
peristyle, along the long sides. Their lengths are not preserved however they are 2 meters wide and 1.50
meters deep.
>The edges were faced in white marble, but the basins had a covering of thick plaster,
painted with two layers of light blue (caeruleum and Alexandrian frit). The short end of the south basin
has two small steps painted blue, but these were later covered in marble.

Although the excavations
uncovered only a small section of the garden, a flowerbed, framed by triangular bricks, and fragments of
flowerpots were brought to light.

*Fig. 4. Axonometric reconstruction of the domus peristyle.*


An Augustan date is appropriate for some architectural and decorative elements, such as the
peristyle column bases without plinths, fragments of architectural terracottas, and frescos found *in situ*
or gathered from the layer of earth rubble that buried the domus.
>Other elements, however, such as a
floor mosaic or fragments from an ornamental wall mosaic could possibly date from slightly earlier
periods. It seems likely that the Augustan dwelling (or dwellings) incorporated an earlier structure
dating to perhaps the middle of the third quarter of the first century B.C. Because most of the decorative
elements reflect the style of the Augustan villa and the contemporary Temple of Apollo on the Palatine,
it is likely this domus was linked to the imperial court, or at least drew inspiration from the new artistic
trends made fashionable by the first princeps.

#### Analysis

It is possible that the domus of the Vigna Barberini was included in Nero’s Domus Transitoria
and/or Domus Aurea, but there are no indications of a Neronian occupation of the site. On the other
hand, it seems clear that the domus did not last beyond Nero’s principate, as attested by a cache of coins
dating no later than 65 A.D. found in the destruction layer. Such destruction could have been the result of landslides caused by two earthquakes that struck Rome in June 68 (Suet. Nero, 48; Galba, 18). Once
ruined the domus was spoiled of most of its elements, the majority of which were dismantled and reused.
